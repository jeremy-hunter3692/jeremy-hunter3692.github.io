          <h2 >Formulate Learning Plan</h2>
            <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>My long term goal in it’s absolute ideal form is to be able to enter into some freelance web development and/or some remote work. I have many other interests 
                  outside of working for income and in and would love to use web development as a way to support that. 
                    I would also very happily settle for some steady income.
                </p>

                <p>Since initially applying for the course I’ve found out about creative coding and would love
                    to get into that more. Both for visuals and relating to music. But
                    overall I’m mainly just aiming to be confident in my skills as a coder and be an 
                    employable worker so I can choose a healthy place to work with some steady income.
                </p>
                  
            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
                <p>I think my problem solving and general experience of practise and learning music  is 
                    one of my main strengths. I feel like I can identify the specific skills and pathways needed to accomplish a goal 
                    and just sitting down to do the regular work.
                </p>
                  
                <p>Limitations would be perfectionism and obsession with finer (un-important) details. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can also get a little obsessive with doing things most efficiently - spending an hour learning how to make a half hour 
                    task take twenty minutes can be a good thing sometimes (especially while learning) but sometimes a task just 
                    needs to be completed rather than done ‘perfectly’. I guess that’s just time/task management. 
                </p>
                  
              <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                  
                <p> 
                    While I feel pretty happy with my human skills at the moment and believe it to be one of my strengths more than the technical side am always
                  looking to improve all of these skill across the board,  but also to identify and have some more experience in 
                  where and how I can apply these in professional setting/in the workplace would be very valuable. More specifically communication is always a particularly helpful skill, 
                    I’m always attempting to improve it but being able to ask a question in the best way, communicate my own thoughts logically, clearly and
                  concisely (that last one I probably need to work on the most). That and being able to foster a confidence in my work and place in a team are some of 
                  the main skills I would like to see developed. 
                </p>
                  
              <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include</h3>                    
                <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives: </h4>

                <p>Keeping in tune with my mood, any external or pressures or issues I might be going through and being mindful of these and how they might influence my
                  actions or my words. 
                </p>

                <p>Being actively mindful of others situations and perspectives, we are each individuals with our own context and struggles. Stay productive by consistently working,
                  Being aware of timeframes+workloads and chunking them all to manageable bits. Time management and planning. 
                </p>
                  
                <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h4>

                <p>Putting in two or three good hours every morning helps me assess where I’m at, 
                    how much help I’ll need and what and where I need to put my focus on as a preventative measure.
                    If I’m struggling I will make sure I plan in breaks/rest, checking in with my partner and friends.
                    Take a walk, meditate, do some music and if it’s really bad talk to a facilitator for help about how 
                    best to approach the situation. 
                </p>
              <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:  </h3>

                <p>I will:  Post in the discord if I’m struggling to figure out the answer myself and/or can’t google it. While waiting I’ll move on to something else I can work on/manage or take a short break. 
                    Then move on to a facilitator to help either guide me to appropriate resources or answer my questions  
                    Ask these questions ahead of time and while I have other things I can work on.
                    I would like to know if it there is some setup where I can request a micro tutoring session or chat. I’ve found a couple of times already where I spent a pretty solid block of time trying to figure something out myself and while sometimes I can learn things this way there are times where I just need someone to give me a short explanation. The kind of thing I would just tap someone on the shoulder and ask If I was at a physical campus. 
                    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
                </p>

              <h3>What you expect from the facilitators</h3>

                <p>I would expect the occasional check in to help me feel confident that I’m doing everything with the
                  appropriate level of detail/scope for projects. I find it helpful just to be able to check in that
                  I’m hitting that right ( Cleaning your room can mean picking the clothes up off the floor or it can mean 
                    pulling out all the furniture, mopping the floors, scrubbing the walls, dusting every surface, alphabetising
                    your books and organising every item into a correct place. I don’t always know where the right middle ground is)
                </p>

                <p>That and just been available for a question or two when I’m struggling with a particular issue/topic.   
                </p>

              <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
                  <p>I’m very lucky to have no pressing commitments at the moment, part of the reason why I was particularly eager 
                  to attend this course with it’s timeframe.
                  </p>

            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </h3>
                    <p>
                      I think my biggest strength and also weakness will be perseverance. It’s a strength in terms of the effort I’m willing 
                      to go to to figure out/learn something as much as I think I need to know/understand it.  It can also be my limitation because 
                      I can spend too much time on that thing with out asking for help. Bootcamp is going to be fast paced and I won’t necessarily have
                       time to do things the way and in the time I would like to take for it. I need to adopt more of the Justin Time approach and check 
                       how long I have spent on a problem and learn to ask for help in a timely manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also need to improve on memorising syntax for different 	functions and methods. I understand in concept what they do and when to use them.
                       But I have to spend quite a lot of time looking up exactly how it works and how to actually write the code correctly. What order things need 
                       to happen in, which brackets wrap around which other thing etc etc 
                    </p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Time management as described above and managing stress. Stress in terms of the day to day stress of existing and other life things that might 
                      pop up during my time in bootcamp. Right down to just making sure there is food in the cupboard and I’m eating well, sleeping well and getting 
                      little bit of time for myself and for me and my partner.
                    </p>
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Still really looking to improve across the board with human skills but especially communicating efficiently. Asking questions in the best possible
                       way and being able to identify and communicate the issue well in order to get the answers I’m looking for. 
                    </p>
            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Without knowing what the format is I would hope there would be people/teachers available to help when needed. Not necessarily answer specific questions
                       but to help guide me to where I need to be looking/researching. If there’s a specific problem/area I’m having continuous trouble with I would hope 
                       I could talk to someone for guidance on how to best attack that problem. Already I’ve found several times there has been an issue I can spend a day trying
                        to figure and it can be explained to me in person in about five minutes. Possibly just the way I learn but it is a lot more efficient for me to be able to 
                        talk one on one to someone.
                    </p>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
                    <p>
                      Assuming that Bootcamp will be vaguely similar in set up to foundations I will ask a facilitator that hour/day or week depending on the importance, scale and 
                      urgency of the problem. I will try and find solutions to a given problem with other students help first if it’s possible and appropriate. Mostly importantly if 
                      it’s something I’ve been spending a disproportionate amount of time on I will make sure to seek assistance and not try to just bash my head against the wall. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I will make sure to do research and study outside of the regular and required hours to keep up to date with where I feel I need to be, and ideally ahead of where
                       we are at in the course to give me time to understand things. This might be watching tutorials, completing small free courses or just researching methods etc after
                        hours each night. At least an hour and up to 4 if really needed. I will also do this on weekends as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I will write out plans for the week and keep an eye on how much time I’m spending on something. Keep an eye out for any out-of-course life stuff that may pop up and plan accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I will keep to my meditation habits, make sure I am also planning in time to check in with myself, go for walk, have a moment alone and free of code/computer screens. As long as I manage 
                      my stress+sleep and don’t let it get wildly out of control I don’t see any problems in dealing with students safely, productively, empathetically and kindly. 
                    </p>
