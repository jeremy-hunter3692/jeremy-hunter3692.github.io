          <h2 >Formulate Learning Plan</h2>
            <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>My long term goal in it’s absolute ideal form is to be able to enter into some freelance web development and/or some remote work. I have many other interests 
                  outside of working for income and in and would love to use web development as a way to support that. 
                    I would also very happily settle for some steady income.
                </p>

                <p>Since initially applying for the course I’ve found out about creative coding and would love
                    to get into that more. Both for visuals and relating to music. But
                    overall I’m mainly just aiming to be confident in my skills as a coder and be an 
                    employable worker so I can choose a healthy place to work with some steady income.
                </p>
                  
            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
                <p>I think my problem solving and general experience of practise and learning music  is 
                    one of my main strengths. I feel like I can identify the specific skills and pathways needed to accomplish a goal 
                    and just sitting down to do the regular work.
                </p>
                  
                <p>Limitations would be perfectionism and obsession with finer (un-important) details. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can also get a little obsessive with doing things most efficiently - spending an hour learning how to make a half hour 
                    task take twenty minutes can be a good thing sometimes (especially while learning) but sometimes a task just 
                    needs to be completed rather than done ‘perfectly’. I guess that’s just time/task management. 
                </p>
                  
              <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                  
                <p> 
                    While I feel pretty happy with my human skills at the moment and believe it to be one of my strengths more than the technical side am always
                  looking to improve all of these skill across the board,  but also to identify and have some more experience in 
                  where and how I can apply these in professional setting/in the workplace would be very valuable. More specifically communication is always a particularly helpful skill, 
                    I’m always attempting to improve it but being able to ask a question in the best way, communicate my own thoughts logically, clearly and
                  concisely (that last one I probably need to work on the most). That and being able to foster a confidence in my work and place in a team are some of 
                  the main skills I would like to see developed. 
                </p>
                  
              <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include</h3>                    
                <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives: </h4>

                <p>Keeping in tune with my mood, any external or pressures or issues I might be going through and being mindful of these and how they might influence my
                  actions or my words. 
                </p>

                <p>Being actively mindful of others situations and perspectives, we are each individuals with our own context and struggles. Stay productive by consistently working,
                  Being aware of timeframes+workloads and chunking them all to manageable bits. Time management and planning. 
                </p>
                  
                <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h4>

                <p>Putting in two or three good hours every morning helps me assess where I’m at, 
                    how much help I’ll need and what and where I need to put my focus on as a preventative measure.
                    If I’m struggling I will make sure I plan in breaks/rest, checking in with my partner and friends.
                    Take a walk, meditate, do some music and if it’s really bad talk to a facilitator for help about how 
                    best to approach the situation. 
                </p>
              <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:  </h3>

                <p>I will:  Post in the discord if I’m struggling to figure out the answer myself and/or can’t google it. While waiting I’ll move on to something else I can work on/manage or take a short break. 
                    Then move on to a facilitator to help either guide me to appropriate resources or answer my questions  
                    Ask these questions ahead of time and while I have other things I can work on.
                    I would like to know if it there is some setup where I can request a micro tutoring session or chat. I’ve found a couple of times already where I spent a pretty solid block of time trying to figure something out myself and while sometimes I can learn things this way there are times where I just need someone to give me a short explanation. The kind of thing I would just tap someone on the shoulder and ask If I was at a physical campus. 
                    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
                </p>

              <h3>What you expect from the facilitators</h3>

                <p>I would expect the occasional check in to help me feel confident that I’m doing everything with the
                  appropriate level of detail/scope for projects. I find it helpful just to be able to check in that
                  I’m hitting that right ( Cleaning your room can mean picking the clothes up off the floor or it can mean 
                    pulling out all the furniture, mopping the floors, scrubbing the walls, dusting every surface, alphabetising
                    your books and organising every item into a correct place. I don’t always know where the right middle ground is)
                </p>

                <p>That and just been available for a question or two when I’m struggling with a particular issue/topic.   
                </p>

              <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
                  <p>I’m very lucky to have no pressing commitments at the moment, part of the reason why I was particularly eager 
                  to attend this course with it’s timeframe.
