       <h2>Javascript-dom</h2>
       <h3>Analogy:</h3>

          <p>If we imagine a website as a vending machine the front of the machine that we see is our webpage. That part that everyone interacts with, the buttons and menus and prices etc all nicely presented and hopefully easy to use.  Javascript would be the inner workings, the machine part in the back. It takes your money, checks it’s the right amount, gives you the change, finds your selection and then delivers you the drink you chose. 
          </p>

        <h3>Control flow:</h3>

          <p>Control flow is like a pick a path book. When normally reading a book you start at the start and read through till the end. In coding we read the instructions from top down to the bottom.  
          </p>

          <p>When we use the various methods of control flow we direct the computer to a different section of the code or instructions . The way a pick a path book sends you to a different chapter and to a different story and/or a different ending.  
          </p>


        <h3>Loops: </h3>

          <p> Is a set of instructions for doing something more than once. A common way we use them is in a situation where we want to keep doing something until it is finished. So you could say keep cooking the pasta until it is done. 
          </p>
          <p>
          A loop would be a set of instructions saying “Is the pasta done yet?” If isn’t done we keep cooking and testing to see if it is done. If it is done then we take it off the stove and drain it. 
          </p>

        <h3>Dom: </h3>
          <p>Is the place for all things website. The world that contains all the different files, images, pages and language types that will work together to make the website. Document Object Model sounds quite fancy/technical and intimidating, but for the most part if we are talking about the DOM we are talking about the whole website and everything that makes up that website. 
          </p>
          
          <p>One of the main interactions with the Dom is with JavaScript. Javascript can find any specific part of the Dom and change it based on instructions.
          </p>
          <p>The easiest example is changing text. If we for some reason wanted to have some code to change the Heading of a webpage we can use a series of javascript instructions to do so. We tell it step by step exactly where things are and in which sections of the Dom. For example
          </p>

          <img src = "/Images/GetElementCode .png" class="img" alt="getElemntByIdexample">
          <p>From left to right we are instructing how to get to a specific part of the html.
          </p>
          <p>“document” : It’s in the document
            <br>
            <br>
            “getElementById”: We are using an ID already assigned to something to get to it. 
            <br>
            <br>
             “Product name” : Is a shifting parameter that will change depending on other circumstances. In this case the name of a specific product that has run out of stock. The content of “Product name” is the name of that product that is out of stock and is the value we want to change. The Id in “getElementById”.
            <br>
            <br>
             "setAttribute" : We want to change or "set" an attribute of that element. ‘Style’, color : red;’ we are changing the style of the attribute and that style is it’s colour and we are chaining it to red. 
          </p>

          <h3>Arrays and objects:</h3>  
          <p>
            An array is really just a list. It can be a list of numbers or words or more complicated things.  I like to think of objects as a fancy arrays. Every item on that list has a description of what it is. Or what we call a key. Each item in this type of list is the value for that key/description. 
          </p>

          <p>You access data from an array by getting the number it is on the list. You access data from an object by getting the description of what it is - the key. 
          </p>


        <h3>Functions:</h3>
        <p> Functions are the part of code that actually does something. They are a set of instructions based on some simple pre determined logic. In a basic form it’s like writing a recipe, or an instruction manual for assembling furniture -except a lot more detailed.
        </p>
        <p>If you imagine how you would write instructions for a magically brand new adult human that has no prior knowledge beyond understanding simple English. That Is how we would write a function. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Step by step to an extreme degree. Instructions for everything that might happen in a given situation and with conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Things like do this if “a” has happened or do this other thing if  “b” has happened. Or if something already exists or not. An example would be  “bake a cake, first check if you have an oven. If you don’t have an oven first complete these steps in this section of the manual to buy the oven then return to this point and carry on.”
