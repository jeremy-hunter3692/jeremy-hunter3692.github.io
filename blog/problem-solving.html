        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
          <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
            <p>
              I couldn’t figure out how I would un-jumble/reverse the spelling of a word using code. <br>I used a rubber-ducky method/sketched 
              out exactly where I needed each letter to move and how and in what order and also wrote down the steps it would take.
              (Take the end letter, Maybe store is somewhere, Put it in the front a new place to store the un-jumbled word) I felt quite 
              frustrated with the mind-blank because I sort of understood what needed to happen but it took me a while to match what needed to happen
               to the methods I could use. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I learnt to step back, take a breather and appropriately chunk the problem. 
            </p>
          <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
            <p>
              Elegantly might be a bit extreme but during fizzbuzz I fairly quickly understood what I needed to do. I broke it down into chunks/each
               thing I needed to use. Quickly researched options on how to do that and found an appropriate method and applied it and then improved what I’d written 
               and made it more efficient. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It felt good to be able to get something that sort of worked quickly and then improve on it (as opposed to usually scrambling to get anything working until the 
              very end) felt more like coding than smashing things together until something kinda worked. 
            </p>

            <p>
              I learn’t the value of understanding and seeing the problem properly and how knowing your basic tools really well can be incredibly helpful. 
            </p>
          <h3> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
            <p>
              Pseudocode: I find to be a very helpful processes. It helps you understand each step you need to take, or at least a great first step. 
              Sometimes when moving from pseudocode to actual code I realise what sounds easy or like one step is actually several in code but this helps me get the thought pattern/approach locked down better.
               For example “take the numbers from the array and feed them into the function…” actually needs to be something like “loop through an array, store the variables, send to function..” Not a perfect example 
               but have run into situations like this several times. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Trying something: Helps me just get started and find my bearings, ideal if something works(can be pleasantly surprised sometimes) but often it just orients me. Sometimes it’s better to push the boat out of the
               harbour and then decide the direction rather than plan your route for ever. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Rubber ducky method: Definitely do this a lot. More in a mumbling to myself sort of way or drawing out what I’m doing/where variables are being sent and stored. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading error messages: Use it all the time, just giving me the vague area where something is wrong. Often it’s the thing just before the actual error message - I’ve missed a bracket or something. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Console.logging: Usually my first thing I go to when things aren’t working. Lets me back track through a longer chunk of code to see where it’s getting stuck.
               No point looking at the later code if the first line isn’t passing the variable correctly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Googling: Can be helpful of course but often time consuming. I usually need a refresher on a specific part of syntax or something like exactly how to access an object key or value with a variable instead of directly. 
              I find MDN incredibly difficult to understand and not that helpful so I have to watch a couple of videos of people explaining it. Helpful but not the most time efficient. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Asking your peers for help: Useful but not very time efficient and I often don’t get the answer I’m actually looking for. I need to be better at communicating my questions clearly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Asking coaches for help: I find this incredibly helpful, can usually  clear up any issues in a minute or two, just hard to lock down and takes me out of my focus mode if we need to organise a call for later on. Can’t expect coaches to be on hand the exact minute you want and answer! 
            </p>
            <p>
              Improving your process with reflection Very helpful reminds me how many approaches there are and that it’s worth swapping to a different approach when you have spent too much time on one.
