        <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
        <h3> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Sometimes I try for too long without help.My ego think I should be able to figure it out myself</li>
              <li>I enjoy helping others once I feel confident at it help me solidify what I've learn't</li>
              <li>I need more habits for helping improve my human skills</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            All of these also help you be a better code in a technical sense. You can learn to be kind to yourself and therefore others as you code.
            That can help you write better and more readable code and comments. Self awareness helps improves the way you learn and therefore get more efficient
            at solving problems. Empathy helps you not get frustrated and angry and also better at explaining code. Values keeps your code tidy and Zen.

          </p>
        <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            How valuable it is to return to things that might seem obvious or things you think you might be good at already. There is always, always more to learn
            in this context. You should always strive to be a better human.
          </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            Feeling overly watched or seen. I like to do this sorts of things in private and writing about it felt quite vulnerable and open to judgement.
          </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            Because it should be a part of all learning. No amount of skill or knowledge should give you permission to not be a good person.
          </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
          <p>
            There was definitely initially some feelings of waste of time mostly because of the intimidation/nerves of not being able to get a grip on the more technical side. 
            It felt like I would rather use that time spent to get a better sense on what is ostensibly the 'real' content of the course. But it definitely wasn't. For me especially
            For the parts that were focused on the way you learn, habits for learning and how to take care of yourself and manage stress.
