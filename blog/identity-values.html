                  <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
                    <h4>Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h4> 

                      <p>A ethical situation that has arisen for me several time over the last decade and has been when someone I know is going through
                          a particularly rough mental health patch and leans on me for support when I am not feeling up to giving it at that time.
                      </p> 

                      <p>My values here have been not wanting to see someone close to me in pain or struggling but also making sure I’m ok, capable of supporting, 
                          and drawing healthy boundaries. 
                      </p>

                        <p>Sometimes the decision I have had to make has  been to bow out of the support role. This has caused some hurt, guilt and pain and changed 
                          some relationships both damaged and helped. But ultimately it has helped me and therefore let me a better longterm support.
                        </p>
                        
                  <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>

                        <p>My values and identity have been through a lot over the last 15 years. My immediate white, middle-class Christian upbringing (and the culture 
                          that that entailed) came with it a very particular view point and set of values that I was not aware of till my late teens. 
                          I spent a lot of time in my 20s setting my values and identity in opposition to that and now try to see it holistically as a part of me,
                          to be aware of certain unhelpful biases, and instinctual attitudes/values that are not my own but my upbringings but at the same time not 
                          throw out every single value just because it was from my upbringing.  Now I believe in creating and fostering my own healthy and 
                          supportive culture, engaging in the best part of our countries/societies culture and watching out for all the negative and unproductive 
                          part of it. I try to grapple with each of my values and think through why I might have a certain attitude and if it’s helpful and healthy.
                        </p> 


                  <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
                      <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
                        <p> Strengths: Problem solving + identifying core issues, creativity, empathy. 
                        </p>

                        <p> Weakness: Over-focusing on details, getting lost in trying to brute force something, taking time to process and understand 
                        new information and it’s implementation. 
                        </p>
                          

                  <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles</h3>

                        <p>Problem solving. Being a life long music student, having many teachers (good and bad) as well as being a music teacher for a long time I
                        think I have a pretty good grasp on how to problem solve and how to systematically improve a skill through practise. 
                      </p>

                        <p>A subset/adjacent part of this skill would a be correctly identifying and confronting problem areas/core issues. 
                        Consistency. I have spent enough time with music to know the value of both rolling up your selves and spending some time on a problem AND how to most efficiently learn and 
                        practice/implement a skill.
                      </p>


                        <p>I personally believe that these skills will get you through almost every learning obstacle. 
                        It means you can focus on the smaller issues and with your end-goal set to the place you can keep yourself on task AND motivated enough to
                        keep trying from several different angles until you find a way past what you are struggling with. 
                      </p>
