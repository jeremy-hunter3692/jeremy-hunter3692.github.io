        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity is fundamental to the way we understand ourselves, learning in general and our perusal approach to learning. Knowing that repetition can fundamentally 
              and physically change our brain opens us up to the power of attitude and 
              approach in not just out learning but our mindset. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Extra to everything discussed in the resources here you can also use this for changing your outlook and mood. It is proven that daily gratitudes/positive thinking can actually 
              physically draw more pathways in your brain. So as silly as it feels if you tell yourself daily that you are capable and something that you are grateful it will train your brain
               into thinking this way by default. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This is something I have been trying to engage in more frequently both for my learning and my mood/outlook. This in combination with the mindfulness habits I hope to use to improve my neuroplasticity. 
              I have used the ‘imagination practise’ a lot in the past while studying guitar and felt it very helpful in certain areas. Even while I was skeptical of it literally changing my brain I could see results in
               the memorising of patterns and scales I was learning and helped me conceptualise some things I had been struggling with.

              An interesting short article about Neuroplasticity and improving well-being:

              Some more in-depth research on meditation and Neuroplasticity

              Growth Mindset is obviously very linked with this concept of Neuroplasticity. Knowing about Neuroplasticity makes the growth mindset the obvious choice in how to proceed and how to approach learning.
               You only have to see someone who believes they can do something vs someone who doesn’t to see how much of a difference it makes. 
            </P>
            <p>
              This is something I’ve seen a lot from teaching, both from my attitude towards the student and their attitude towards their own learning.  The combination of the two is often interesting and sometimes, 
              on my worse days as a teacher, I have been more pessimistic about a students ability only to see them achieve more than I thought faster than I thought because of their own self belief and enthusiasm. 
              The opposite has also been true. Growth mindset is something I’ve been aware of for a long time and already very engaged in. Something I was surprised about was how almost blind/stupid optimism can be really helpful. 
              If you don’t really understand the immensity of a task ahead of you or the odds against you you will jump in with enough enthusiasm optimism and growth mindset to get you through.

            <p>
              I think reminding myself of how much is possible and how both staying away from negative self talk and embracing a positive+growth mindset will be fundamental to my approach for learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Making it a habit to think/self-talk positively and believe in my abilities in conjunction with meditation and focus practise as well as taking time to approach each task with this mindset
              will be valuable asset to my learning plan and feed back into it’s effectiveness.  I will also remember to make it a part of my problem solving. When things are feeling too much I will stop take a breather, refresh myself and then approach it again with a I can do this/positive/growth mindset. Re-focusing myself on this will be the first step before attempting any actual coding.
