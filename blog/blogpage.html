                <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
                  <h4>Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h4> 

                     <p>A ethical situation that has arisen for me several time over the last decade and has been when someone I know is going through
                        a particularly rough mental health patch and leans on me for support when I am not feeling up to giving it at that time.
                     </p> 

                     <p>My values here have been not wanting to see someone close to me in pain or struggling but also making sure I’m ok, capable of supporting, 
                        and drawing healthy boundaries. 
                     </p>

                      <p>Sometimes the decision I have had to make has  been to bow out of the support role. This has caused some hurt, guilt and pain and changed 
                        some relationships both damaged and helped. But ultimately it has helped me and therefore let me a better longterm support.
                      </p>
                      
                <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>

                      <p>My values and identity have been through a lot over the last 15 years. My immediate white, middle-class Christian upbringing (and the culture 
                        that that entailed) came with it a very particular view point and set of values that I was not aware of till my late teens. 
                        I spent a lot of time in my 20s setting my values and identity in opposition to that and now try to see it holistically as a part of me,
                         to be aware of certain unhelpful biases, and instinctual attitudes/values that are not my own but my upbringings but at the same time not 
                         throw out every single value just because it was from my upbringing.  Now I believe in creating and fostering my own healthy and 
                         supportive culture, engaging in the best part of our countries/societies culture and watching out for all the negative and unproductive 
                         part of it. I try to grapple with each of my values and think through why I might have a certain attitude and if it’s helpful and healthy.
                      </p> 


                <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
                    <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
                      <p>	Strengths: Problem solving + identifying core issues, creativity, empathy. 
                      </p>

                      <p>	Weakness: Over-focusing on details, getting lost in trying to brute force something, taking time to process and understand 
                      new information and it’s implementation. 
                      </p>
                        

                <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles</h3>

                      <p>Problem solving. Being a life long music student, having many teachers (good and bad) as well as being a music teacher for a long time I
                      think I have a pretty good grasp on how to problem solve and how to systematically improve a skill through practise. 
                     </p>

                      <p>A subset/adjacent part of this skill would a be correctly identifying and confronting problem areas/core issues. 
                      Consistency. I have spent enough time with music to know the value of both rolling up your selves and spending some time on a problem AND how to most efficiently learn and 
                      practice/implement a skill.
                     </p>


                      <p>I personally believe that these skills will get you through almost every learning obstacle. 
                      It means you can focus on the smaller issues and with your end-goal set to the place you can keep yourself on task AND motivated enough to
                      keep trying from several different angles until you find a way past what you are struggling with. 
                     </p>

                <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                    <p>My long term goal in it’s absolute ideal form is to be able to enter into some freelance web development and/or some remote work. I have many other interests 
                      outside of working for income and in and would love to use web development as a way to support that. 
                        I would also very happily settle for some steady income.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since initially applying for the course I’ve found out about creative coding and would love
                         to get into that more. Both for visuals and relating to music. But
                        overall I’m mainly just aiming to be confident in my skills as a coder and be an 
                        employable worker so I can choose a healthy place to work with some steady income.
                    </p>
                      
                 <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
                    <p>I think my problem solving and general experience of practise and learning music  is 
                        one of my main strengths. I feel like I can identify the specific skills and pathways needed to accomplish a goal 
                        and just sitting down to do the regular work.
                    </p>
                      
                    <p>Limitations would be perfectionism and obsession with finer (un-important) details. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can also get a little obsessive with doing things most efficiently - spending an hour learning how to make a half hour 
                        task take twenty minutes can be a good thing sometimes (especially while learning) but sometimes a task just 
                        needs to be completed rather than done ‘perfectly’. I guess that’s just time/task management. 
                    </p>
                      
                  <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                      
                    <p> 
                        While I feel pretty happy with my human skills at the moment and believe it to be one of my strengths more than the technical side am always
                       looking to improve all of these skill across the board,  but also to identify and have some more experience in 
                       where and how I can apply these in professional setting/in the workplace would be very valuable. More specifically communication is always a particularly helpful skill, 
                        I’m always attempting to improve it but being able to ask a question in the best way, communicate my own thoughts logically, clearly and
                       concisely (that last one I probably need to work on the most). That and being able to foster a confidence in my work and place in a team are some of 
                       the main skills I would like to see developed. 
                    </p>
                      
                  <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include</h3>                    
                    <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives: </h4>

                    <p>Keeping in tune with my mood, any external or pressures or issues I might be going through and being mindful of these and how they might influence my
                       actions or my words. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Being actively mindful of others situations and perspectives, we are each individuals with our own context and struggles. Stay productive by consistently working,
                       Being aware of timeframes+workloads and chunking them all to manageable bits. Time management and planning. 
                    </p>
                      
                    <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h4>

                    <p>Putting in two or three good hours every morning helps me assess where I’m at, 
                        how much help I’ll need and what and where I need to put my focus on as a preventative measure.
                        If I’m struggling I will make sure I plan in breaks/rest, checking in with my partner and friends.
                        Take a walk, meditate, do some music and if it’s really bad talk to a facilitator for help about how 
                        best to approach the situation. 
                    </p>
                  <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:  </h3>

                    <p>I will:  Post in the discord if I’m struggling to figure out the answer myself and/or can’t google it. While waiting I’ll move on to something else I can work on/manage or take a short break. 
                        Then move on to a facilitator to help either guide me to appropriate resources or answer my questions  
                        Ask these questions ahead of time and while I have other things I can work on.
                        I would like to know if it there is some setup where I can request a micro tutoring session or chat. I’ve found a couple of times already where I spent a pretty solid block of time trying to figure something out myself and while sometimes I can learn things this way there are times where I just need someone to give me a short explanation. The kind of thing I would just tap someone on the shoulder and ask If I was at a physical campus. 
                        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
                    </p>

                  <h3>What you expect from the facilitators</h3>

                    <p>I would expect the occasional check in to help me feel confident that I’m doing everything with the
                       appropriate level of detail/scope for projects. I find it helpful just to be able to check in that
                       I’m hitting that right ( Cleaning your room can mean picking the clothes up off the floor or it can mean 
                        pulling out all the furniture, mopping the floors, scrubbing the walls, dusting every surface, alphabetising
                        your books and organising every item into a correct place. I don’t always know where the right middle ground is)
                    </p>

                     <p>That and just been available for a question or two when I’m struggling with a particular issue/topic.   
                     </p>

                  <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
                      <p>I’m very lucky to have no pressing commitments at the moment, part of the reason why I was particularly eager 
                      to attend this course with it’s timeframe.
