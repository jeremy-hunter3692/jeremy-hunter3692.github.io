        <h3>Eq vs IQ </h3>
          <p>For me I’ve always viewed eq as everything that is being a person except what we traditionally call ‘Intelligence’. Sometimes it is called emotional maturity. It is being aware of your own emotions and how they inform your actions and perceptions. 
          </p> 
          <p>If you can be aware of this in yourself you become more sympathetic and empathetic to it in other people, and sometimes Vice Versa.  If you can learn to be kinder to yourself it is often easier to be kinder and more respectful of others and if you are struggling with it for yourself doing it to others can be a helpful place to start. The way people often say treat yourself as you would a friend. 
          </p>

          <p>I think the core of it really comes down to understanding that your emotions (even if not obviously or consciously) effect your everyday decisions and actions, and that the more you can understand and observe this in yourself the better you will be and the more you can see it in others and therefore understand, respect and have empathy for them. 
          </p>

          <p>Eq is vital for all human interaction and just being a human, it means we become more autonomous and are not just reacting to every whim of our emotional brain. It helps us be more empathetic, more respectful, more productive, more loving, happier and calmer. There is such a long list of why it is important but I believe at it’s core it is about being more in control, or rather less reactive, of yourself through awareness and being present. 
          Emotional intelligence is something that is easier to understand in concept than to practise and act upon. I find daily habits and reminders can be incredibly helpful and I really find listening to people talk about it helps me fall more into the mindset of eq/awareness. I lean slightly more specifically into Buddhist teachers or talks for this kind of stuff, hearing discussions and interviews with these great teachers and practitioners helps you get a better conception of it and more consistently of how to approach it and to improve it. Daily practise is hard but very helpful and a lot of murky waters around how it works becomes clear in the practise.
